This pidgin-plugin implements xmpp message delivery receipts (XEP-0184).
When no delivering confirmation is displayed, it is also possible that
the receiver doesn't support the extension.

	$ make all

You will need pidgin delevopment packages
(link in ubuntu: libpurple-dev and pidgin-dev).


INSTALL

To copy the extension to your personal plugin folder (~/.purple/plugins)
run:

	$ make install

Now you may activate the extension within the pidgin settings.
